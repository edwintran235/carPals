# Brief Overview of the Application
Carpals is an easy-to-use platform that connects commuters in need of a ride with drivers who have available seats. The app aims to foster a sense of community, sustainability, and safety by reducing traffic, lowering commuting costs, helping the environment, and benefiting the economy. It allows users to carpool based on routes, schedules, and preferences, with riders contributing to gas costs. Drivers earn rewards, and users can rate and review rides, building a trusted network for regular carpools.
